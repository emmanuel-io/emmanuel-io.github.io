      <description>Learn how to migrate a WordPress site between hosting plans, avoid high renewal fees, and troubleshoot issues like .htaccess prepends causing 500 errors.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="context-the-migration-decision">Context: The migration decision</h2>
<p>When faced with the high renewal cost of a hosting plan, I had to make a choice: either pay up for another year or move the site to a more affordable plan. Since the site is more of a branding tool for its writer than a revenue-generating machine, the budget-friendly option was the clear winner. After all, this wasn’t about profitability — it was about maintaining the site without the burden of high renewal costs.</p>
<p>Given that my involvement in this project is pro bono, I’ve been looking for ways to keep costs low until the ultimate goal is realized: <strong>migrating everything to Hugo</strong>. This will take careful planning since there are <strong>over 3,000 articles</strong> to account for. But for now, the priority was to avoid paying a steep renewal price while maintaining control over the site.</p>
<p>So, I opted to move the WordPress site to a more affordable hosting plan. It wasn’t as simple as I expected, but the goal was clear: move the site, <strong>save on renewal fees</strong>, and hopefully learn something along the way. 🚀</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="step-1-backup-the-easy-way">Step 1: Backup, the easy way</h2>
<p>The first step in the migration was backing up the entire WordPress site — including both the files and the database. For this, I took advantage of the easy routes provided by Hostinger, which offered a simple way to create a tar.gz file for the entire site and a database backup through their hPanel UI. These steps were straightforward and saved a lot of time in setting up the backups, I could prepare myself a coffee in the meantime. ☕</p>
<h2 id="step-2-upload-challenges">Step 2: Upload challenges</h2>
<p>The real challenge came when I tried to upload the tarball I just downloaded. The 30GB file was far too large for a single upload through the web client: with an estimated transfer time of 8 hours — a duration that was way too long — it was just too slow and, frankly, risky to rely on this method.<br>
Especially with a 1MB/s connection, which was likely throttled by the web interface. 😤</p>
<p>That’s when I checked if SFTP and SSH access were available on my plan. This turned out to be a game-changer: it gave me much more control over the transfer process. And I was able to upload files at twice the speed of the web client. ⚡</p>
<p>With SSH access in hand, I made sure the <code>cat</code> and <code>tar</code> commands were available on the server (you&rsquo;re never too sure). Then after splitting my archive into multiple files, I was able to upload the parts using SFTP and, once all the parts were on the server, I reassembled the files into the original tar.gz archive before unpacking them. This method provided more stability and speed than relying on the web interface.</p>
<p>Steps summary for file upload:</p>
<ol>
<li>Split the archive on local.</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">split -b 1G large_backup.tar.gz large_backup_part_
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Upload the parts to the new host using sftp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SSH</strong> into the new host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reassemble the parts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">cat large_backup_part_* &gt; large_backup.tar.gz
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="5">
<li>Extract the files.</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">tar -xzvf large_backup.tar.gz -C public_html
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="6">
<li>Finally, move the extracted files where needed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Side note</strong>: At this point, I was starting to question my decision. Surely the time I was spending here could have been spent elsewhere, maybe paying the renewal and keeping things simple. 🤔</p>
<h2 id="step-3-the-migration-or-how-i-broke-everything">Step 3: The migration or how I broke everything</h2>
<p>Once the files were uploaded to the new plan, the next step was the database migration. Importing the database via <strong>phpMyAdmin</strong> was super smooth, I just removed all the existing tables before the import and voila. ✔️</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s configure WordPress to use this db by editing <code>wp-config.php</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>I updated the database details in <code>wp-config.php</code>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;DB_NAME&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;new_database_name&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;DB_HOST&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;new_database_host&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><ol start="2">
<li>Update site URLs in the database <code>wp_options</code> table to point to the new domain:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">UPDATE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">wp_options</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">SET</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">option_value</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;http://yournewdomain.com&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">option_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;siteurl&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">OR</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">option_name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;home&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="step-4-the-htaccess-issue---a-lesson-in-troubleshooting">Step 4: The <code>.htaccess</code> issue - A lesson in troubleshooting</h2>
<p>So far, so good. But when I went to test the site, I encountered an issue.</p>
<p>Here’s where things got fun. After migrating the site and testing, I was faced with 500 internal server error.<br>
Turns out, my trusty <code>.htaccess</code> file had some prepending rules; thanks to the Wordfence plugin that caused conflicts with the WordPress redirects.</p>
<p>Turns out that the plugin was prepending the wrong path, leading to broken redirects. A little digging in the <code>.htaccess</code> file revealed the issue.</p>
<p>Here’s a anonymized version of the problematic section:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-apache" data-lang="apache"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c"># Wordfence WAF</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">&lt;IfModule</span> <span class="s">LiteSpeed</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">php_value</span> auto_prepend_file &#39;/home/user-identifier/domains/politicothon.com/public_html/wordfence-waf.php&#39;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">&lt;/IfModule&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">&lt;IfModule</span> <span class="s">lsapi_module</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">php_value</span> auto_prepend_file &#39;/home/user-identifier/domains/politicothon.com/public_html/wordfence-waf.php&#39;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">&lt;/IfModule&gt;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c"># END Wordfence WAF</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>The Fix:</strong> I just commented out the faulty lines, ensuring that the redirects were working properly, and retriggered the htaccess modifications from the plugin. It finally worked. 🎉</p>
<h2 id="step-5-moving-emails-and-other-unexpected-tasks">Step 5: Moving emails and other unexpected tasks</h2>
<p>Of course, no migration is ever just about the site files. I also had to move the emails. Thankfully, Hostinger’s made this relatively painless.</p>
<h2 id="final-testing-and-adjustments">Final testing and adjustments</h2>
<p>By now, everything was uploaded, configured, and most issues were resolved. But like any migration, I did some final checks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flush Permalinks</strong> in WordPress: This ensured no broken links.</li>
<li><strong>Test the site</strong>: I manually visited the site to verify latest pages, posts, and media were intact.</li>
<li><strong>Verify emails</strong>: I sent and received a few test emails to confirm success. ✅</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion-is-the-time-spent-worth-it">Conclusion: is the time spent worth it?</h2>
<p>Looking back, the migration was a learning experience. Sure, I saved on the renewal cost, but the time spent troubleshooting, moving files, dealing with .htaccess issues, and transferring emails likely cost me more in time than simply renewing the plan.</p>
<p>But in the end, I gained valuable insight into WordPress configurations, server-side troubleshooting, and hosting management. It’s a lesson that will definitely help me in future migrations — though next time, I might just pay the renewal and avoid the hassle. <strong>Time is money</strong>, after all.</p>
<h3 id="next-up-moving-a-wordpress-site-to-hugo">Next Up: Moving a WordPress Site to Hugo</h3>
<p>If WordPress to WordPress migration was ok, next time, I’m going to take on the challenge of moving from WordPress to Hugo. It&rsquo;s bound to be a much more challenging adventure — and this time, I might even save more time (or spend less in the process!).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Lesson learned</strong>: Sometimes, the <strong>convenience of not moving</strong> comes at the cost of the <strong>time spent</strong> in the process. 😜</p>

      <title>Why I Chose Hugo: Performance, Simplicity, and Long-Term Value</title>
      <link>https://emmanuel-io.github.io/posts/why-choose-hugo/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 08:00:00 +0400</pubDate>

      <description>Discover why Hugo is the static site generator of choice for developers who value speed, control, and low maintenance. A personal reflection from a software engineer.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a backend developer focused on optimization and long-term value, I want tools that are fast, lean, and reliable. When building my personal blog and portfolio site, I needed a solution that matched the way I think and work — one that’s developer-friendly, low-maintenance, and future-proof.</p>
<p>After evaluating the landscape, I chose <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> — an open-source static site generator — and haven’t looked back.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-a-traditional-cms">Why not a traditional CMS?</h2>
<p>Popular platforms like WordPress, Ghost, Medium, or Wix offer convenient interfaces and polished templates. But they come at a cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting fees and plugin lock-in</li>
<li>Security updates and patch cycles</li>
<li>Slow loading times without heavy caching</li>
<li>Database maintenance and migration risk</li>
<li>Dependency on a live admin dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t want any of that.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-really-wanted">What I really wanted</h2>
<p>I wanted a blog that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>🚀 <strong>Fast</strong> — page loads under 100ms</li>
<li>💸 <strong>Cheap to host</strong> — static content deployable on free GitHub Pages</li>
<li>🛠 <strong>Minimal to maintain</strong> — no database, no updates, no runtime environment</li>
<li>📁 <strong>Markdown-first</strong> — content is portable, editable offline, and version-controlled</li>
<li>🌍 <strong>Multilingual</strong> — because I write in both English and French</li>
<li>🧩 <strong>Customizable</strong> — I want full control over structure, theme, and behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>Hugo ticked all those boxes.</p>
<h2 id="why-hugo-stands-out">Why Hugo stands out</h2>
<p>Unlike other static site generators, Hugo is built with performance and simplicity in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>⚡ <strong>Blazing fast</strong> — Hugo can generate thousands of pages in milliseconds.</li>
<li>🧠 <strong>Go-powered</strong> — written in the Go language, it’s fast and robust.</li>
<li>🧱 <strong>Modular structure</strong> — perfect for evolving your site without rebuilding it from scratch.</li>
<li>🌐 <strong>Built-in multilingual support</strong> — no plugins needed.</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Works perfectly with GitHub Pages</strong> — and integrates easily with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="it-aligns-with-how-i-build">It aligns with how I build</h2>
<p>I treat my blog like code:</p>
<ul>
<li>I write in Markdown.</li>
<li>I version everything with Git.</li>
<li>I preview locally and deploy automatically via GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>My content lives in my repo, not in someone else’s database.</li>
<li>The site loads fast, even with no JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hugo respects my time — no plugins to babysit, no broken updates, no servers to reboot.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-value">Long-term value</h2>
<p>The more I work in tech, the more I value tools that reduce complexity and create leverage. Hugo offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>🧩 <strong>Portability</strong> — Markdown and static assets will still work 10 years from now</li>
<li>💰 <strong>Cost control</strong> — hosting is free or nearly free</li>
<li>🧘 <strong>Peace of mind</strong> — no attack surface, no updates to break the site</li>
<li>🧪 <strong>Developer joy</strong> — everything is text, Git, and logic</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not interested in buzzwords — I’m interested in value over time. Hugo is a system that rewards you for keeping things simple.</p>
<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>
<p>Hugo is not just a blog engine — it’s a platform for thoughtful publishing. Whether you&rsquo;re a developer, writer, or entrepreneur, it&rsquo;s a tool that helps you build fast, low-maintenance websites that scale with your ideas — not your hosting bills.</p>
<p>That’s why I chose Hugo.</p>

      <description>Set up GitHub Actions and deploy your Hugo blog using SSH deploy keys and a dual-repo strategy.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In part 1 we explored how I created a website using Hugo, now we are going to create a github action to automatically deploy the site on github pages when we create a commit.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-of-git-repositories"><strong>Set up of Git repositories</strong></h3>
<p>I created 2 GitHub repositories for the project:</p>
<ol>
<li>First Repository for the hugo project <code>emmanuel-io.github.io.hugo</code></li>
<li>Second repository to host my blog as Github User page <code>emmanuel-io.github.io</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You can find on a lot of articles who are using 2 differents branches of the same repository (&ldquo;main&rdquo; for the project, &ldquo;gh_pages&rdquo; for the generated static files), however I prefere to have two distinct repositories, each one dealing with a different concern.</p>
<p>Now go to the root of the project and execute below commands.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># create the .gitignore file</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">touch .gitignore
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># add the public folder to the list of ignored files</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&#34;public/&#34;</span> &gt;&gt;.gitignore 
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># commit any uncommitted changes</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git commit -a -m <span class="s2">&#34;init&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># set remote origin branch</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git remote add origin https://github.com/emmanuel-io/emmanuel-io.github.io.hugo.git
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># push changes</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git push -u origin main
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I have ignored the <code>public</code> directory as we don&rsquo;t need to handle it in the repository.</p>
<p>Now we need to generate a pair of public/private keys to be able to use github actions from the 1st directory to write in the 2nd repository.
To understand what I did, you can check these links from the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action">GitHub Action</a> used to deploy my hugo website.</p>
<p>Have a particular look at this part:
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action#%EF%B8%8F-create-ssh-deploy-key">Create SSH Deploy Key</a></p>
<p>Do as stated but <strong>NOT IN YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY !!!</strong></p>
<p>Now in the root directory I created a github workflow yaml file to make sure that every time I push to remote, my blog is updated by github. In VSCode I created this file in &ldquo;.github/workflows/deploy.yml&rdquo;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl"># A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="push-your-content"><strong>Push your content</strong></h3>
<p>Now we have set up our repositories and created our static content in <code>public</code> directory . The only step remain is pushing our local content to GitHub. Lets do that now. Run below commands in the terminal</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1"># commit any uncommitted changes</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git commit -a -m <span class="s2">&#34;deploy with actions&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git push -u origin main
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And thats it.</p>
<p>Now my blog is updated on every push :-)</p>
<p>You can match your content and configuration with below repositories. The only difference is the value of <code>baseurl</code> that is because I have set up this demo website as Project Site and not the User Site.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I needed a space to showcase my work, share ideas, and write articles — whether tutorials, reviews, editorials, or blog posts. GitHub is great for hosting code, but I wanted a space of my own online. This blog also serves as my digital portfolio.</p>
<h2 id="what-were-the-options-for-blogging">What were the options for blogging?</h2>
<p>Some popular options for getting started with a blog include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wix.com/blog">Wix</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These platforms offer end-to-end solutions with nice features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on content with built-in formatting</li>
<li>SEO optimization</li>
<li>In-browser editing interfaces</li>
<li>Media and plugin support</li>
<li>Abstracted handling of themes, databases, hosting, and updates</li>
</ul>
<p>But I wanted something free, minimal, and fully under my control.</p>
<p>GitHub Pages offers <a href="https://pages.github.com/">free hosting for static content</a> — no backend, no database — just HTML, CSS, JS. That constraint inspired me to explore <strong>static site generators</strong>.</p>

<p>🚧 <em>My reasons for choosing Hugo, and a deeper look at why I use it, will be covered in a dedicated follow-up post.</em></p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-blog">Setting up the blog</h2>
<p>I followed this 5-step process (inspired by <a href="https://bhanuchaddha.github.io/create-your-own-blog-website-using-hugo-in-less-than-1-hour-for-free/">Bhanu Chaddha&rsquo;s article</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Hugo</li>
<li>Create a project</li>
<li>Set up Git</li>
<li>Install a theme via submodule</li>
<li>Add content and run the site</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything below is based on my experience using Ubuntu 22.04. You may want to adapt it using the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/">official Hugo setup instructions</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-install-hugo">1. Install Hugo</h3>
<p>On Ubuntu:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">sudo snap install hugo --channel<span class="o">=</span>extended
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then verify the installation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo version
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You should see output similar to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo v0.96.0+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2022-03-26T09:15:58Z
</span></span></code></pre></div><hr>
<h3 id="2-create-your-hugo-project">2. Create your Hugo project</h3>
<p>Navigate to the folder where you want your blog project to live:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Documents
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo new site emmanuel-io-github-io-hugo
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will create the Hugo project structure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /home/emmanuel/Documents/emmanuel-io-github-io-hugo.
</span></span></code></pre></div><hr>
<h3 id="3-initialize-git">3. Initialize Git</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">cd</span> emmanuel-io-github-io-hugo
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git init
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git branch -m main  <span class="c1"># If your default is still &#39;master&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><hr>
<h3 id="4-install-a-theme-using-git-submodule">4. Install a theme using Git submodule</h3>
<p>For this blog, I used the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gohugo-theme-ananke/">Ananke theme</a>. I added it as a submodule to keep it clean and version-controlled:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
</span></span></code></pre></div><hr>
<h3 id="5-add-example-configuration-and-content">5. Add example configuration and content</h3>
<p>To get a working site quickly, I copied the sample content and config from the theme:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">cp -R ./themes/ananke/exampleSite/<span class="o">{</span>config.toml,content*,static*<span class="o">}</span> ./
</span></span></code></pre></div><hr>
<h3 id="6-run-the-hugo-development-server">6. Run the Hugo development server</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo server
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Open <a href="http://localhost:1313">http://localhost:1313</a> in your browser to view the site.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="7-start-customizing">7. Start customizing</h3>
<p>At this point, I began adapting the configuration and writing my first content.</p>
<p>👉 <em>In the next post, I’ll cover how I structured the blog, added multilingual support, integrated GitHub Actions, and customized the theme.</em></p>

<h2 id="-hi-im-emmanuel-io">👋 Hi, I’m emmanuel io</h2>
<p><strong>Digital Solutions Developer</strong><br>
100% remote · Performance-driven · Outcome-oriented</p>
<p>With over 25 years in the software industry, I build thoughtful, high-performance systems — from embedded platforms and backend APIs to automation workflows and developer tools.</p>
<p>I’ve worked across microcontrollers, FPGAs, electronics, cloud services, and SaaS platforms — always with a focus on clean architecture, maintainability, and long-term value.</p>
<p>I’m comfortable working solo or within multicultural, multi-skilled teams. I thrive in asynchronous collaboration, and I love writing clear, readable code that lasts.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-my-work-philosophy">🧠 My Work Philosophy</h2>
<p>Here are some principles that guide how I build software and work with others:</p>
<ul>
<li>🎯 <strong>KISS</strong> — Keep It Simple and Stupid.</li>
<li>🎯 <strong>DRY</strong> — Don’t Repeat Yourself.</li>
<li>🎯 <strong>Consistency beats intensity</strong> — Think long-term.</li>
<li>🎯 <strong>Explain it</strong> — If it can’t be explained, it’s not understood.</li>
<li>🎯 <strong>Simplify</strong> — If it’s too complex, break it down.</li>
<li>🎯 <strong>Be like water</strong> — Adapt to the flow.</li>
<li>🎯 <strong>Be open and transparent</strong> — Feedback drives improvement.</li>
<li>🎯 <strong>Break the rules when it makes sense</strong> — But do it with purpose and accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the one rule that overrides all others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🎯 <strong>Knowledge is multiplied when shared.</strong> Never keep it to yourself.</p></blockquote>
